# &#129361; Avocado Manager 2019 &#129361;
Manage your avocados like it's 2019.

And learn GKE and Google Cloud Build while you're at it.

## Architecture
The application consists of two components:

* backend
  * Java 8/Quarkus/MicroProfile application
  * exposes one rest endpoint `/avocados` which returns a list of JSON objects
* frontend
  * JS/React/NPM/Nginx front end
  * uses the backend service to populate a list of avocados to display


## Setting up Cloud Build with triggers
The project is build using Google Cloud Build:
https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/

The steps are defined in `cloudbuild.yaml` files for each subproject:

* backend
  * cloudbuild: https://github.com/blofroth/avocado-manager/blob/master/backend/cloudbuild.yaml
  * Dockerfile: https://github.com/blofroth/avocado-manager/blob/master/backend/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm
* frontend
  * cloudbuild: https://github.com/blofroth/avocado-manager/blob/master/frontend/cloudbuild.yaml
  * Dockerfile: https://github.com/blofroth/avocado-manager/blob/master/frontend/Dockerfile

To set up triggers to build on every commit, go to build trigger configuration in the GCP webconsole:
https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers

* First you need to connect your repository to GCP Cloud build
* Then add the two triggers as below:
    * ![Backend trigger](/docs/trigger-backend.png)
    * ![Frontend trigger](/docs/trigger-frontend.png)

## Deploying manually into a GKE cluster

1. Set up a GKE cluster, e.g. following this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)
    * Make sure `kubectl` is set up towards a working cluster after
2. Set an environment variable to your current GCP project
    * `export PROJECT_ID=...`
3. Deploy and expose the backend microservice:
    * `kubectl run avocado-backend --image=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/avocado-manager-backend`
    * `kubectl expose deployment avocado-backend --port 80 --type LoadBalancer`
4. Write down the public IP of the service, waiting until it gets assigned:
    * `kubectl get svc -w`
    * `export BACKEND_HOST=...`
5. Deploy and expose the frontend microservice:
    * `kubectl run avocado-frontend --image=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/avocado-manager-frontend`
6. Edit the frontend deployment:

    * `kubectl edit deployment avocado-frontend`
    * Add the environment config just below `image: ...`, substituting for your actual IP noted in previous steps:
    ```
    env:
    - name: BACKEND_ROOT
      value: "http://35.228.235.121"
    ```
7. Wait for the frontend to automatically get redeployed when saving the file
8. Check the public IP of the frontend:
  * `kubectl get svc -w`
9. Open the IP in a browser, and voil√†, avocados!
